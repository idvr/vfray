This project is the source code for the paper: "Memory Efficient GPU-Based Ray Casting for Unstructured Volume Rendering" available in:

http://dx.doi.org/10.2312/VG/VG-PBG08/155-162

The code is implemented using C/C++ and C for CUDA.  The algorithm provides both CPU and GPU versions of VF-Ray: Visible-Faces Driven Ray Casting.
